            <b>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</b>
            <p>I made one major change to the Segway Centaur website, as suggested by a friend. 
                I added images to the home page for each section of the Segway centaur description. 
                I felt there was a need to include images because they would help exploit the more admirable nature of segway centaurs, improve the aesthetic nature of the website, and thus focus more on customer satisfaction.
                 My friend also asked that I make the headings of each section blue for emphasis. However, I rejected his proposal because it would have resulted in color overload, which would have negatively impacted usability and consistency.

           <b> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </b>
            <p>Progressive enhancement is a web design strategy that prioritizes web content.
                 This enables the creation of a design that is simpler but still usable for users of older 
                 browsers and devices with limited capabilities, while also providing the best possible experience to users of newer browsers and devices with rich capabilities.
                 Progressive enhancement also ensures faster content loading by allowing crawling by web search engines to load pages' text through HTML code rather than waiting for Javascript to initiate and load content subsequently. 
                 This means that ready-to-consume content is served instantly, not behind layers. Progressive enhancement is important because it allows anyone with any browser or internet connection to access a website's basic functionality and content.
